The main goal of this course is to **learn how to use these new powerful AI models** for game development, either during game creation or as part of the gameplay to unlock innovative experiences!

And the best way to learn is **by doing**. That's why we decided that to get your certificate of completion (it's free!) you need to provide a demo you built yourself or as part of a team.

Indeed, at the end of the course you'll **have your own game demo using AI**.

Here are the **criteria for validating the game demo**:

- Have a **team from 1 to 5 teammates**.
- Have a working demo that can **run either on WEBGL or Windows**.
- The Demo and application must be in **English**.
- The game must use **at least one open-source tool as part of the game or workflow**.

If you don't have ideas yet, **don't worry**, we wrote some "Demo Units" that will help you define your game demo and avoid common pitfalls (scope too big etc).

## How do I choose which Game Engine to use?

It’s up to you. For now, **we advise you to use Unity** since we produced most of the content for this v1 of the course with their tools. 

In general, we strongly advise you to choose a game engine and not develop a game from scratch with only code. The goal to build a demo in one month is already a big step, adding complexity is not a good idea.


## But... I don't know how to make games!

Don’t worry, that's the perfect time to start! If you want to start making games with Unity, check their amazing [Create with Code course](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code), where you'll learn how to make 5 different games. This free introduction will give you everything you need to be able to follow our Making Games with AI Course.

## The Certification Process

You can get a free certificate of completion at the end of the course. **We'll explain later how to get it 🤗**.

## What tools do I need?

The minimum tools you need are:

- *A computer* with an internet connection.
- A *Hugging Face Account*: (it’s free), to use AI models and publish your game demos.
- A *Game Engine License*. A free version is enough in most cases. Naturally, you could create your game from scratch, but we strongly advise you to use a Game Engine. We generally recommend Unity, as the first iteration of this course uses Unity tools. You can also use Unreal if **you're prepared to translate the concepts to their environment**.
