After all this information, it's time **to get started**. We're going to do two things:

1. **Create your Hugging Face account** if you don't have one.
2. **Sign up to Discord and introduce yourself** (don‚Äôt be shy ü§ó)

### **Let's create my Hugging Face account**

(If you don't have one), create an account to Hugging Face **[here](https://huggingface.co/join)**

### **Let's join our Discord server**

You can now sign up for our Discord Server. This is the place where you **can chat with the community and with us, create and join study groups to grow with each other, and more**

If this is your first time using Discord, we wrote a Discord 101 to get the best practices. Check the next section.

üëâüèª Join our discord server **[here.](https://discord.gg/hugging-face-879548962464493619)**

When you join, remember to introduce yourself in #introduce-yourself and sign up for ML-4-Game-Development in #role-assignments.

Here's all the ML for Game Development channels:

- `ml-4-games-course-announcements`  : where we give the **latest information about the course**.
- `ml-4-games-course-announcements-study-group`: where you can **ask questions and exchange with your classmates**.
- `ml-4-games-dev`: where you can **exchange about ML for games development.**
- `ml-4-games-searching-for-team`: where you can search for a team if you want to build demos in the team.
- `ml-4-games-i-made-this`: where you can **share your projects and models**.


Congratulations! **You've just finished the onboarding**. You're now ready to start learning how to make games with AI. We still have two sections in this unit with advice on how to get the best out of this course and how to use Discord.

### **Keep Learning, stay awesome ü§ó**
