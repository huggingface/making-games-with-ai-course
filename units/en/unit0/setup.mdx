After all this information, it’s time **to get started**. We’re going to do two things:

=======

1. **Create your Hugging Face account** if it’s not already done
2. **Sign up to Discord and introduce yourself** (don’t be shy 🤗)

### **Let’s create my Hugging Face account**

(If it’s not already done) create an account to Hugging Face **[here](https://huggingface.co/join)**

### **Let’s join our Discord server**

You can now sign up for our Discord Server. This is the place where you **can chat with the community and with us, create and join study groups to grow with each other and more**

If this is your first time using Discord, we wrote a Discord 101 to get the best practices. Check the next section.

👉🏻 Join our discord server **[here.](https://discord.gg/hugging-face-879548962464493619)**

When you join, remember to introduce yourself in #introduce-yourself and sign-up for ML-4-Game-Development in #role-assignments.

- `ml-4-games-course-announcements-study-group`: where you can **ask questions and exchange with your classmates**.
- `ml-4-games-dev`: where you can **exchange about ML for games development.**
- `ml-4-games-searching-for-team`: where you can search for a team if you want to build demos in team.
- `ml-4-games-i-made-this`: where you can **share your projects and models**.


Congratulations! **You’ve just finished the on-boarding**. You’re now ready to start to learn making games with AI. We still have two sections in this Unit with advices to get the best of this course and how to use Discord.

### **Keep Learning, stay awesome 🤗**
