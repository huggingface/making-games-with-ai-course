Discord is a free chat platform. There is a Hugging Face Community Discord server with more than 70K members,  you can **[join with a single click here](https://discord.gg/hugging-face-879548962464493619)**

Starting in Discord can be a bit intimidating, **so let me take you through it**.

You'll choose your interests when you [**sign up to our Discord server**](https://discord.gg/hugging-face-879548962464493619). Make sure to **click "ML for Game Development"**, and you'll get access to the "Game Dev" category containing all the course-related channels. If you feel like joining even more channels, go for it! 🚀

Then click next, and you'll get to **introduce yourself in the `#introduce-yourself` channel**.

Here's all the ML for Game Development channels:

- `ml-4-games-course-announcements`  : where we give the **latest information about the course**.
- `ml-4-games-course-announcements-study-group`: where you can **ask questions and exchange with your classmates**.
- `ml-4-games-dev`: where you can **exchange about ML for games development.**
- `ml-4-games-searching-for-team`: where you can search for a team to build demos with.
- `ml-4-games-i-made-this`: where you can **share your projects and models**.

Here's some advice:

- Don't hesitate **to participate often in the Discord channels**, it's how you'll get the most of the course by meeting new people interested in AI in games, finding coworkers, and getting advice.
- There are **voice channels** you can use as well, although most people prefer text chat.
- You can **use markdown style** for text chats. So, if you're writing code, you can use that style. Sadly, this does not work for links.
- Don't hesitate **to create threads when you write a message**. It's a good idea when **it's a long conversation.**
- We want to keep this **Discord** server safe for everyone, so if you see some bad behavior, don't hesitate to tag @admin.
