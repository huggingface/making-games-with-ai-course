## What the course looks like

The course is composed of:

- *A theory part*: where you learn the **concepts in theory**.
- *A hands-on part*: where you'll work on demos we created to implement the AI.
- Your demo: you'll build this during the course!


## What this course covers üó∫Ô∏è

## What this course does not cover

This course **is not an introduction to game development**. You should have some skills in Unity or Unreal to follow this course effectively.

This course **is not an introduction to Machine Learning or AI**. You may find this course helpful if you're interested in the concepts behind language processing with ML: [Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course).


## Recommended Pace

Each unit in this course is designed to be completed **in 1 week**, with approximately 3-4 hours of work per week. 

However, you can take as much time as necessary to complete the course, **there are no deadlines**. If you want to dive deeper into a topic, we'll provide additional resources to help you achieve that.

The recommended pace is **to work on one unit per week**. For the demo you need to make, we recommend **to work from two weeks to one month maximum**.
