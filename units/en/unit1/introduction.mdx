# Introduction

Welcome to the first Unit of the course! 

The integration of cutting-edge AI models in video games is opening a whole range of new exciting gameplays. One of them is the ability for Non-Player Characters (NPCs) **to understand and respond to the player‚Äôs voice or text inputs**. And this is what we‚Äôre going to do today.

Indeed, in this Unit, **you're going to integrate your first AI model in your Unity game and make it run locally**.

You're going to learn:

- What is Sentence Similarity?
- The difference between **running an AI model locally or remotely** (using an API).
- What the [Hugging Face Hub ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/models?library=unity-sentis) is.
- How to run an AI model locally with [Unity Sentis](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.sentis@latest) and [Sharp Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/sharp-transformers).

And you're going to make this demo, where a **smart robot that can understand your orders and perform them**.

You can download the Windows demo üëâ [here](https://singularite.itch.io/jammo-the-robot-with-unity-sentis)

To make this project, we‚Äôre going to use:

- Unity Game Engine (2022.3 and +).

- The Jammo Robot asset made by [Mix and Jam](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyVUwlB_Hahir_VsKkGPIA).

- [Unity Sentis library](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.sentis@latest), the neural network inference library that allow us to **run our AI model directly inside our game**.

- The [Hugging Face Sharp Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/sharp-transformers)): a Unity plugin of utilities to **run Transformer ü§ó models in Unity games**.

You can download the complete Unity Project by clicking üëâ [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/unity-demos/resolve/main/unit1/Jammo%20the%20Robot%20Sentis%20(v2).zip?download=true)

At the end of the project, you‚Äôll build your own intelligent robot game demo. 


And then, you‚Äôll be able **to iterate with other ideas**:


For instance, after making this game, I created this Dungeon Escape demo ‚öîÔ∏è with the same codebase, **where your goal is to flee from this jail by stealing the üîë and the gold without getting noticed by the guard**.

But I also worked on a stealth game, where you **guide your character to sneak in a party and steal some stuff**.

You'll be also able to improve the demo, [by adding a Speech To Text model to give order to the robot with your voice!](https://thomassimonini.substack.com/p/building-ai-driven-voice-recognition)

Sounds fun? Let‚Äôs get started!
