# Let's build our smart robot NPC demo ü§ñ 

## Step 0: Get the project files

You can find the üëâ [complete Unity project here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/unity-demos/resolve/main/unit1/Jammo%20the%20Robot%20Sentis%20(v2).zip?download=true)

## Step 1: Install Unity Sentis

The Sentis Documentation üëâ https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.sentis@latest

1. Open the Jammo project

2. Click [Sentis Pre-Release package](https://tinyurl.com/4eun48fb) or go to Window > Package Manager, click the + icon, select "Add package by name‚Ä¶" and type "com.unity.sentis"

3. Press the Add button to install the package.

## Step 2: Install Sharp Transformers üí™

[Sharp Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/sharp-transformers) is a Unity plugin of utilities to **run Transformer ü§ó models in Unity games**.

We need to do it for the tokenization step.

Go to "Window" > "Package Manager" to open the Package Manager.

Click the "+" in the upper left-hand corner and select "Add package from git URL".

Enter the URL of this repository and click "Add": [https://github.com/huggingface/sharp-transformers.git](https://github.com/huggingface/sharp-transformers.git)


## Step 3: Build the inference process üß†

As described in [Sentis documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.sentis@latest), to use Sentis to run a neural network in Unity, we need to follow these steps.

1. Use the Unity.Sentis namespace.

2. **Load a neural network** model file.

3. **Create input** for the model.

4. **Create an inference engine** (a worker).

5. **Run the model** with the input to infer a result.

6. **Get the result**.

In our case, we do all of this in **SentenceSimilarity.cs** file, that will be attached to our robot.

In awake, we:

1. **Load our neural network.**

2. Create an **inference engine** (a worker).

3. **Create an operator**, that will allow us to perform operations with tensors.

We have three functions:

1. *Encode*: takes our player input (text), **tokenizes it, and embeds it**.

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/unity/sentis-similarity2.jpg" alt="Sentis Similarity"/>

2. *SentenceSimilarityScores*: **calculate the similarity scores** between the input embed (what the user typed) and the comparison embeds (the robot action list)

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/unity/sentis-similarity3.jpg" alt="Sentis Similarity"/>

3. *RankSimilarityScores*: get the **most similar action** and its index given the player input

## Step 4: Build the Robot Behavior ü§ñ

We need to define the **behavior of our robot**.

The idea is that our robot has different possible actions and the choice of the actions **will depend on most similar actions**.

We need first to define the *Finite State Machine*, a simple **classical AI technique where each State defines a certain behavior**.

Then, we‚Äôll make the utility function **that will select the State hence the series of actions to perform**.

### The State Machine üß†ü§ñ

In a state machine, **each state represents a behavior**, for instance, moving to a column, saying hello, etc. Based on the state the agent is **it will perform a series of actions**.

In our case, we have 7 states:

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/unity/fsm.jpg" alt="Jammo State Machine"/>

The first thing we need to do is create an enum called State that contains each of the possible States:

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/unity/fsm2.jpg" alt="Jammo State Machine"/>

Because we need to constantly check the state, **we define the state machine into the Update() method using a switch system where each case is a state**.

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/unity/fsm3.jpg" alt="Jammo State Machine"/>

For each state case, we define the behavior of our agents, for instance in our state Hello, the robot **must move towards the player, face him correctly, and then launch its Hello animation, then go back to an Idle State**.

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/unity/fsm4.jpg" alt="Jammo State Machine"/>

We have now defined the behavior for each different State. The magic here will come from the fact **that‚Äôs the language model that will define what State is the closest to the Player input**. And in the utility function, we call this state.


### Let‚Äôs define the Utility Function üìà

Our action list looks like this:

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/unity/utility1.jpg" alt="Utility"/>

- The sentence is what will be embedded in the AI model.

- The verb is the State

- Noun (if any) is the object to interact with (Pillar, Cube, etc.)

This utility function will **select the Verb and Noun associated with the sentence having the highest similarity score with the player input text.**

But first, to **get rid of a lot of strange input text**, we need to have a similarity **score threshold**.

For example, if I say ‚ÄúLook at all the rabbits‚Äù, **none of our possible actions are relevant**. Hence instead of choosing the action with the highest score, we‚Äôll call the State Puzzled which will animate the robot with a perplexed animation. 

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/unity/rabbits.gif" alt="Jammo rabbits"/>

If the score is higher, then **we‚Äôll get the verb corresponding to a State and the noun (goalObject) if any**.

We set the state corresponding to the verb. That will activate the behavior corresponding to it.

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/unity/utility2.jpg" alt="Utility"/>

And that‚Äôs it, **now we‚Äôre ready to interact with our robot!**


## Step 5: Let‚Äôs interact with our Robot ü§ñ

In this step, you just need to click on the play button in the editor. And you **can prompt some orders and see the results**!


That's nice! But the best way to learn is to try things, break things and modify the demo.


## (Optional) Improving the game: let‚Äôs add a new action

Adding a new action is quite easy. Let‚Äôs take an example:

- Copy the YellowPillar game object and move it

- Change the name to GreenPillar

- Create a new material and set it to green

- Place the material on GreenPillar

Now that we‚Äôve placed the new game object, we need to add this possibility into the sentences and click on Jammo_Player.

In the list of actions click on the plus button and fill in this new action item:

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/unity/optional-jammo1.jpg" alt="Utility"/>

- Add Go to the green column
- GoTo
- GreenColumn

And that‚Äôs it! **You can easily iterate and add more actions to your game**.

Again, don't forget to test the similarity threshold, **to see if you need to increase it or decrease it**.
