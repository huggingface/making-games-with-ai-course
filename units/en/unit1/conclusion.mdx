# Conclusion

Congratulations, with a few steps we’ve just built a robot that’s able to perform actions based on your orders that’s amazing!

What you can do next is dive deeper into the code in Scripts/Final and look at the final scene in Scenes/Final. I commented on every part of it so it should be relatively straightforward.

Also, don’t hesitate to check Unity Sentis Samples, a repository that contains very nice example and template projects.
