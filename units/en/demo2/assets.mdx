# Assets (don't reinvent the wheel)!

One of the significant **time-consuming aspects of game development is creating assets**. Assets are any element in the game, including 3D models, 2D graphics, music, sound effects, and more.

## Pros and Cons of Using Assets

Utilizing pre-made asset packs can be a game-changer, but it's essential to weigh the pros and cons:

For a quick demo or prototype, we think that using existing assets can **significantly speed up the development process**.


If you're unsure about using assets, you should watch this very good series of videos by [David Wehle](https://www.youtube.com/@DavidWehleGames) where he talks about how he bought and modified assets to be able to make and finish his successful game alone: [The First Tree](https://store.steampowered.com/app/555150/The_First_Tree/?l=french).

## Best Practices for Using Assets

1. **Always Check the Copyright**

Before incorporating any asset into your game, **ensure you have the right to use it**. 

2. Always Credit the Artist:

When using assets created by others, **provide proper attribution to the original artists**.

3. Keep Your Style Consistent:

**Maintain a cohesive visual and auditory style throughout your game**. If you opt for a low-poly aesthetic, use low-poly assets to ensure a coherence.
