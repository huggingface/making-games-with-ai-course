<Tip>
The course is now **self-paced and will not have new future units**. We **don't provide a Certificate of Completion for this course**.
But we continue to write tutorials on how to use AI in Games here ðŸ‘‰ https://thomassimonini.substack.com/
</Tip>

Welcome to this exciting Unit, **where you'll define and polish your game idea and write your Game Design Document ðŸ¤©**.

As we explained during the introduction Unit, the goal at the end of this course is that **you'll build a game demo using either**:

- **AI tools to help you build the game** (texture generation, AI voice actors...)
- Using **AI in the game as gameplay or for the NPC**.

This course has three types of Units:

- *Course Unit*: learn a concept and apply it with a hands-on.
- *Demo Unit*: define and work on your demo.
- *Bonus Unit*: dive into advanced concepts such as classical AI in games or ML for 3D.

This Unit is a Demo Unit.

So, in this first Demo Unit, **you will define your game idea and write your Game Design Document (GDD)**. 

This GDD, a one-page document, will help you define the following:

- Gameplay mechanics
- The story (if any)
- Which AI model/tools you're going to use
- What assets you're going to need
- The scope
- The team (if any)


During the course, we'll emphasize the importance of **keeping your scope small** to be able to finish your demo.

For this section, **we curated the best resources you can find online**.

So let's get started!
