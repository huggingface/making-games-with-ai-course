# Step 2: Let's write the Game Design Document

## What is a Game Design Document (GDD)?

A Game Design Document (GDD) is an important tool in the game industry: it's the **blueprint of a video game project**.

In this document, we outlines the:
- Gameplay of the game, 
- Features
- Game mechanics
- Scope
- Assets
- And more.

The GDD **ensures a clear definition and understanding of the game's vision for all teammates** and facilitates the development process.

In the case of our demo, **we want to write a concise one-page document**.

## The One Page Game Design Document Template

This is our One Page GDD template, you can naturally add or remove elements based on your needs.

### Game Title ✍️

- Brainstorm and define potential game titles.

### Team and roles 👯

- Clearly outline your team members and assign specific roles to each member.

### Game Concept 🤯

- Define your single sentence description of the game that **you will use to guide you during design decisions**.

## Game Genre 🏷️

- Clearly identify the genre of your game.

## Game Features and AI tools/model used 🤖

- List and describe the planned game features, along with any AI tools or models you intend to incorporate.

## Platform 🖥️

- On what platform do you want to publish it? Remember it needs to work either on HuggingFace Spaces (WEBGL) and/or Windows.

## Scope ⏲️

- Establish the expected playtime. We think a 10min maximum play is a good scope for this course.

## Art Style 🎨🖌️

- Determine the desired art style for your game's assets, such as low-poly, stylized, or realistic.

## Level 🖼️

- Define what your level will look like (that will help to know how much assets do you need).

## Assets 📦

- Define the assets you need to make this game. We're going to talk about assets and how to find them in the next demo unit.

## Todo 📝

- What needs to be done, think of this section for now as a brain dump to note everything that comes to your mind that need to be done in the game.


## A Game Design Document One Page Example: Museum Robery

To help you visualize better how this tool is useful, we're going to give an example below with a game called Museum Robery.

[Museum Robery]

### Game Title ✍️

- Museum Robery
- Roomba Heist

### Team and roles 👯

- Thomas Simonini

### Game Concept 🤯

You’re a thief that controls with your voice a robot cleaner in a museum at night and your role is to steal the golden duck. A very expensive statue without getting caught by lasers and guards.

### Game Genre 🏷️

- Infiltration

### Game Features and AI tools/model used 🤖

- Command the robot using your own voice (ASR)

- The robot will understand what action to make (Sentence Similarity)

- The robot can steal stuff and break stuff

### Platform 🖥️

- WebGL

### Scope ⏲️

- 10min play
- 3 levels

### Art Style 🎨🖌️

- Low poly
- Using Unity Feel library for the nice touch additions

### Levels 🖼️

In addition to this, I like to write a list of **learning goals** when I make a demo, in this case my learning goals were:

### Learning Goals 🏆

- Make a game from beginning to the end
- Publish it
- Learn to use the Hugging Face API
- Learn better to use Navmesh
- Learn to use sound
- Learn to use animation and break
- Learn to use Feel
