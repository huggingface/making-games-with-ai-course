# 2D Assets Generation 🎮

One **of the most critical elements in game development for 2D games is the ability to produce high-quality 2D assets with a beautiful aesthetic.**

For a long time, AI was **unusable because of its lack of consistency** (you were not able to generate the perfectly same character in multiple generations, for instance). Fortunately, with LoRA and other innovations, this problem is a thing of the past.

In this section, I'll present my favorite tool it's [Scenario](https://www.scenario.com/) ❤️ It's an impressive tool **we will use in a future Unit of the course.**


## Scenario

[Scenario](https://www.scenario.com/) is a platform that allows you **to generate 2D assets using text-to-image models and fine-tune these models with specific styles.**

The foundation model is Stable Diffusion (SD 1.5 and SDXL), two **open-source models.**

The power of Scenario comes from its platform and its powerful tools.

First, you can easily fine-tune **the generative model to a specific style.**

**Either by composition,** by combining different LoRA styles that are available. For instance, this beautiful picture was made by mixing 3 LoRA components.

You can **do the same for characters.**

Or by **training your own LoRA** using generated images or original ones.

- With the upscaler tool you can increase **the quality of the output up to 10k resolution** and **correct some artifacts made by the generation.**
