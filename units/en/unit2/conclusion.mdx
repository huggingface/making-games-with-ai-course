You have some tools you think we should add? We wrote a [Awesome AI Tools for Game Developers list](https://github.com/simoninithomas/awesome-ai-tools-for-game-dev) where you can add tools.

In addition to this Unit that provides you with the best tools, we wrote a blogpost where I dive deep into:

- Why integrating AI is essential: Understanding how it can amplify your creativity.
- Cutting through the buzz: Identifying where AI is a game-changer in your workflow and recognizing its limitations.
- The mindset for successful integration: Adopting a growth mindset to leverage AI as a tool rather than seeing it as a threat.
