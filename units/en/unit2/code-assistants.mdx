# Code Assistants 👩‍💻

Code Assistants are helpful when you **need help coding a function or when you find a bug in your code and want to know why**.

## Unity Muse Chat 💸 🔒

Muse Chat is a **conversation AI in Unity Editor** that can answer your Unity questions and help you with code and debugging.

What's impressive about this tool is that **it's context-aware of the project.** This means it has information about your project, the game objects, etc., so you don't need **to explain it in the prompt.**

It's a handy **tool to accelerate your game development workflow**.

For instance, I'm using it to help me build the next unit demo: it's an **action-adventure game about aliens 👽 invading a space station. Your goal is to outsmart them and flee.**

You can win the game by leaving the station, but to do that, you need to find your equipment, escape hatch password, etc., without getting noticed.

Sounds exciting? **It's a demo you'll be able to play and modify during this course 🔥**

For this game, I need the red light to flicker **to convey the sense of alertness in the space station.**

So, I clicked on my point light and **asked Muse how to create this.**

What's impressive about Muse is that in addition to providing the code, it shared with me a **well-defined explanation of why the code works this way and its sources.**

And this is the result:

If you're not using Unity but another game engine, you should use GitHub Copilot. **It's one of my favorite tools when I code in Python.**

**Copilot is not a free tool**, but it's **free for verified students, teachers, and maintainers of popular open-source projects**. So, if you contributed to open-source projects, **you are eligible to use it for free.**
