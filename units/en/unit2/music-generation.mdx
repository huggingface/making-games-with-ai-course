# Music Generation ðŸŽµ

Music Generation offers game developers **the ability to create music that perfectly matches the intended mood or atmosphere** of the scene.

## Udio ðŸ”’ðŸ’¸

[Udio](udio.com/) is a **generative AI model that produces music based on prompts**.

Whatâ€™s interesting is that you c**an generate music instrumental or with lyrics.**

For now, you can make 600 daily generations (music)!

Udio can generate excellent music with lyrics; you can check their examples on the website.

But for the game demo Iâ€™m working on for the future unit, where youâ€™re stuck in a ship with aliens, I **needed something abstract and uneasy**, so I used this prompt: *a piece of instrumental music on space void and threatening aliens*

And I got this, **and this is perfect for my game menu

The model generates 33 seconds of the music, but you can then **ask the model to extend it.**

## **MusicGen** ðŸ†“ ðŸ¤—

This model, made by Meta AI, allows you to **generate 15 seconds of music** with a text prompt and sound file to help control the style of the music.

I used the same prompt as above and I got this lovely result:
