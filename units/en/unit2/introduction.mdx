Welcome to this exciting new Unit all about AI tools for Game Development ðŸ§°!

Up until now, when we studied ML for Games in this course, we learned **how to integrate AI models inside our games to unlock new and exciting gaming experiences.**

However, another big part of ML for Games **is using powerful AI tools during the pre-production and production phases.**

These tools have two advantages:

- **Fasten your game development workflow** by automating some creation tasks.
- **Empower your game development skills** by allowing you to produce content you could not do before with a small team (2D assets, music, animation, voice actors... ).

In this Unit, **we cherry-picked two tools per topic** that we love and that you should try in your game development.

**We provide a code system** to help you know if the tool is open-source or not and if it is free or not.

ðŸ¤—: Open-source

ðŸ”’: Closed-source (proprietary)

ðŸ’¸: Paid tool (often with a free tier)

ðŸ†“: Free tool

So let's get started!
