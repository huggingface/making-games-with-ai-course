We **can't wait to see the amazing demos you're going to make ðŸ”¥**. 

You can:

- Share your demo on LinkedIn and X, and tag us  @cubzh_ @gigax @huggingface **we'll repost it** ðŸ¤—. 

- But also share it on the [Hugging Face Discord server in the #ml-4-games-i-made-this channel](https://hf.co/join/discord).

## Teach your NPC new skills

For this part of the unit, it's [Tristan](https://x.com/tr_deborde), the founder of Gigax, that made a video tutorial where you're going to teach a NPC new skills ðŸ”¥.

**The name of the Space changed, it's not ai-npc anymore but NAME.**

## Bonus: customize your NPCs

In addition, to being able to teach your NPCs new skills you can customize the assets you want to use in your demo thanks to a free library of 25k assets.

For instance, I want the NPC to give me a hat. For now, they give me a party hat when I ask them if they have a party hat for me.

But there's so many more funny hats to try.

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-ml-4-games-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit3/hats.png" alt="Cubzh Hats" />

To do that, I selected 6 funny hats you can replace with:

- pratamacam.chicken_hat: Chicken Hat
- claire.sombrero: Sombrero
- exoticwilper.hat: Bear hat 
- creativitial.cap: Child cap
- claire.napoleon_hat: Napoleon Hat
- claire.cowboy_hat: Cowboy hat


It's quite simple, the skill we want to customize is GIVE_HAT skill.

You need to go to Files and click on cubzh.lua
