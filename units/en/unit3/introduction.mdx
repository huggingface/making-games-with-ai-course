Welcome to the third unit of the course!

In this unit, weâ€™ll **explore how LLM-powered NPCs can create immersive gaming experiences**. 

To illustrate this, weâ€™ll dive into *NPC-Playground* created through the collaboration of the [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh/) and [Gigax](https://github.com/GigaxGames/gigax) teams, showcasing the potential of smart LLM-powered NPCs.

You can play the demo here ðŸ‘‰ [Link to Demo]

In this 3D demo, you can **interact with the NPCs and teach them new skills with just a few lines of Lua scripting!**

Beyond just learning about the demo, **youâ€™ll have the opportunity to modify it and create your own version**.

ADD ILLUSTRATION 

By customizing the game, **youâ€™ll gain confidence in navigating the Cubzh documentation and building new, unique experiences**.

Sounds fun? Letâ€™s get started!
